Firstly, the registration app records the registrant’s details (an image and ID) by taking a picture of registrant as well as recording down their ID. The image will be uploaded to the Publit.io platform via their API and the URL created will be sent over to firebase. \n This information is then sent over to Firebase and then analysed on the Python backend, with the Facenet model. After a result is obtained, the result is sent back to the registration app so that the user knows he is completed with the process. Lastly, we have another native Android application for administrators at the event. This app tracks the attendance of all registrants that are already present. This application also allows the administrator to do a manual confirmation of the registrant’s identify should the algorithm fail."

The box contains an in-built gyroscopic sensor which serves to detect any angular changes. When these changes are detected, servo motors oriented in the different axes are activated to correct the orientation of the central platform by an equal and opposite angle. In addition, the tray can also be used in multiple configurations. After our user studies, we found that waiters often hold their trays with one hand and serve food with the other. As such, we designed the tray to be either set at the one-handed or two-handed mode. With multiple options for carrying the tray and a reliable self-balancing feature, waiters need not worry about dropping items ever again."
